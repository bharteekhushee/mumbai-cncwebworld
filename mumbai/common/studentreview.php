                            better career. The mentors and their learning techniques are unique and always ready to
                            help you in any manner they can. After a long pause in my career, I was way too confused
                            and not confident enough that whether I will be able to stand on my own again or not.
                            But not only I am independent now but also confident with the new opportunities in my
                            career ahead.Thank you cnc web world and the team.

                            lecturing, he use to explain about some topics before we asks doubtsabout that topic.
                            Because he knows that where we are going to ask doubt about that specic topic. It might
                            be the reason he was experienced on giving those lectures. Its my pleasure to having him
